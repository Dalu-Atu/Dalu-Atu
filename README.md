# 👋 Hello, I'm Dalu-Atu

🎯 Senior Software Engineer | 🏗 Architect | 🤝 Problem Solver

---

With over a decade of experience building and scaling systems, I bring a calm, pragmatic approach to software development. I specialize in designing resilient architectures, leading engineering teams, and translating business goals into clean, maintainable code.

I value clarity over cleverness, people over process, and simplicity over trendiness.
