# 👋 Hello, I'm Daniel Atu

🎯 Full-Stack Engineer | 🏗 Designer | 🤝 Problem Solver

---

I build web applications with the MERN stack that solve real business problems. Over 3 years, I've created AI tools that save educational institutions hours of work, complex web scraping systems, and data pipelines that handle real-world complexity.

I value clarity over cleverness, people over process, and simplicity over trendiness. See what I've built 👇
